# Plant-Disease-Detection (based on CNN and YOLO)

🌿 Plant Disease Detection System <br>
An AI-powered computer vision system that detects plant leaf diseases using deep learning models. This project combines YOLO-based leaf detection and a CNN-based disease classifier to accurately identify diseases from images or live camera feeds.<br>

📌 Overview <br>
Plant diseases significantly impact agricultural productivity. Early and accurate detection is essential for timely intervention. This system automates the detection process by:<br>
Identifying plant leaves using object detection<br>
Classifying detected leaves into healthy or diseased categories<br>
Supporting real time detection via webcam or image input<br>
The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and deployable for real world agricultural applications.<br>
